# VOLBEATS MUSIC

## ABOUT
This project utilizes the Spotify Web API to create a Spotify Clone with updated themes and UI features.  

Uses Spotify's authentication to be able to gain access to the user's Spotify profile and playlists they have created. Once authenticated, you will be granted access to Volbeats Music, which will allow the user to see user's top playlists, look through the user's liked songs, and pick any song to have playback through a connected Spotify Device. 


**TO PLAY MUSIC**

`User must either open the Spotify Application on their computer or open Spotify on the Web Browser so that they have an active device. Device icon by volume slider will show if you have any active devices. Once you have an active device, either refresh Volbeats Music and sign back in so that the authentication will allow access to play music off an active device. You may then pick any song through Volbeats Music for it to begin playing.`

**Authentication Tokens last for 1 hour**
