# VOLBEATS MUSIC

## ABOUT
This project utilizes the Spotify Web API to create a Spotify Clone with updated themes and UI features.  

Uses Spotify's authentication to be able to gain access to the user's Spotify profile and playlists they have created. Once authenticated, you will be granted access to Volbeats Music, which will allow you to see your top playlists, look through the user's liked songs, and pick any song to have playback through a connected Spotify Device. 

That basically means that the user just needs to have Spotify open on their computer, either in the web browser they are using, or the Spotify Application. Once that is up, a refresh in Volbeats Music and a connection to the active playback device is all that is needed to be able to play the songs!
